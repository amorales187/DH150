# San José Resources

## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Lillian Nguyen
Being back in San Jose during the COVID-19 quarantine, I’ve decided to focus on my hometown for this project, specifically the unexplored resources that the city provides. I’ve lived in San Jose my entire life until I moved away to attend UCLA, where I realized the vast resources that the school provides. I wanted to explore whether my city offers anything cool and interesting for the public, so I browsed the internet and found two resources: an online archives catalog that conserves the city’s historic collections and an app to report any issues in the San Jose area. By improving the UX design, the site and app would become more user-friendly and accessible, creating a more well-informed and safe community. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
The following 0 to 4 rating scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems:
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

### Heuristic Evaluation of Website: History San José Online Catalog
https://historysanjose.pastperfectonline.com/
History San José, a non-profit organization under the City of San José, aims to preserve and enrich the cultural heritage of San Jose and surrounding area through research and collections, to name a few. This growing online catalog holds over 30,000 records of photographic collections, images of material culture, archives, and libraries. The homepage has 3 main components: the navigation bar, the body with information on the catalog, search methods, and image orders, and the footer with contact information. The navigation bar has 8 items: “Home,” “Keyword Search,” “Advanced Search,” “Random Images,” “Archives,” “Photos,” “Libraries,” and “Objects.”

#### Initial Evaluation 
The search tools and information architecture are particularly concerning and hinder a user’s efficiency. The keyword and advanced search tools have their own pages and specific functions, making the search task more complicated. I was also very confused on what the menu items entail due to the terminology (e.g. random images versus photos, archives versus libraries) and what types of records fit within each category. There is also no organization or hierarchy of content within each of the other links when a user first lands on the page since it is just a layout of random records; they are not subcategorized either. 

#### #1: Visibility of System Status
Markup : * Each menu item block in the navigation bar changes color when the cursor is hovered over it, which gives a clear distinction
