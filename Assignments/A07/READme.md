# DH150 Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Prototype by Lillian Nguyen

## Overview

**Project Description**

The project aims to improve the San Jose 311 app by solving 3 main tasks:
1. Make a report
   - a step-by-step application process
1. Check my reports
   - includes a status bar
   - ability to edit report after submission
1. Check other reports with filter/advanced search
   - map and list view to see other reports
   - advanced filtering to search 

**Purpose**: High fidelity prototyping allows people to visualize the product while it is functional and interactive so that users could test it out and designers can continue to iterate and make improvements.

**Process**: The prototype was created using **Adobe XD**. After collecting user research data and creating personas/scenarios, I drew low-fidelity prototypes based on the needs of the targeted users. From there, I continued to revise my prototype based on the in-class impression test and cognitive walkthrough.
