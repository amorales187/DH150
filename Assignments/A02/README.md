# DH150 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Testing by Lillian Nguyen

## Introduction

**San Jose 311** is an app created by the City of San Jose for requesting city services by submitting a report on the problem that needs to be taken care of. It allows people to report an issue to the City service team, who will help resolve the request and update users on the status of the report. Users need to sign up to create an account (or continue as a guest) in order to report on most issues, such as abandoned vehicles, graffiti, illegal dumping, potholes, and streetlight outages. They are able to check the status of their reports, view and follow reports made by other people, or find other information/services. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing (UT)
The purpose of a usability test is to improve the usability of the product by observing and testing the users and gathering their feedback. UT helps to identify specific problems from a heuristic evaluation and tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to the users. Compared to a heuristic evaluation or other inspection methods, UT is the best way to understand the participant's behaviors and thoughts while being able to observe them navigate the product. 

## Methodology

The UT will test the three metrics of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. I moderated the usability test with my sister as the participant in a quiet room (with two minor interruptions in the background). The **pre-test questionnaire** measures the user's first impressions of the app homepage. I observed the user interact with the app through three **task scenarios** to learn how the app design affects the userâ€™s ability to complete routine tasks. The **post-test questionnaire** measures the user's experience using the app, in terms of ease, time, likelihood to do the task again. The **System Usability Scale** measures the user's attitude toward the app and its usability. The **Product Satisfaction Cards** determine how the app makes them feel. The entire process took about 35 minutes.

Heuristic Being Tested | Usability Problem  | Task Scenario  |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Help recognize, diagnose, and recover  | Takes extra time to create a new report because modal boxes do not efficiently address all errors  | Sign up to make an account and create a new report  | 
User control and  freedom  | Cannot edit/make changes/delete a report after it has been submitted  | Edit/make a change in a submitted report  |
Flexibility  | Difficult to search for other reports because cannot filter with multiple criteria  | Search for a report by filtering with multiple criteria  |


**Process of the Usability Test:**
* Introduction
* Informed Consent
* Background Questions
* Pre-Test Questions
* Task Scenarios 
* Post-Test Questionnaire
* System Usability Scale (SUS)
* Product Satisfaction Card
* Demographics

I used an app called **Mirroring** to display my phone screen on my laptop. I used **QuickTime Player** to video record the user and myself, as well as record my laptop screen with the phone screen and video recording. I stopped the recording at the demographics section and thanked her for her time afterwards.
