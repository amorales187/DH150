# DH150 Assignment 4: User Research by Lillian Nguyen

## Description of Project

### Main Design 
**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**

This UX project will support users in making a quicker and easier process of reporting issues, checking report status, and searching reports made by others within the San Jose community. This serves to provide timely services to the areas in need by directing more responsibility and initiative toward the people involved, thereby creating a more engaged and active community.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**

This activity fulfills the basic need for safety since a user works on making their physical space safer (e.g. streetlight outage) and cleaner (e.g. illegal dumping) by requesting the city’s services to handle the problem. Although the basic need is not immediately satisfied, it is in the process of satisfying both an individual and public need.

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

A couple of solutions to satisfy this need is by calling the 311 (the non-emergency phone number) or submitting the service request online. A passive but common method is just ignoring the problem and waiting for neighbors or people with more authority to take notice and solve the issue.

**What improvements could be made with (digital) technology?**

:exclamation: No way to keep track and check status of a submitted report, which makes people impatient and out of the loop

:exclamation: Too many phone calls on non-emergency issues that take time to process 

:exclamation: Takes extra effort to record/remember/describe the location of the problem through phone call

:exclamation: Too many reports on the same issue

:grin: Transparent status checks on submitted reports

:grin: Quick and easy process for reporting an issue

:grin: Option for people to place a location marker on their reports

:grin: Search reports made by other people to stay informed about what is going on in the community

### Target Users
**What are the characteristics of the users (e.g. demographics, preference, expertise)?**

San Jose resident, homeowners, has children (care about the neighborhood for children's safety), adult users (mostly 18+), some level of technology skills, all genders, areas with more crime/lower income

**Where would the users do that activity (e.g., context of use)?**

The app can be used anywhere the person chooses. A user should take a photo, remember the location, and acquire additional details of the issue to make the report, so it would be helpful to use the app near the problem area upon encountering it. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)?**
* To submit a report, a user should take a photo or have a photo on their device, know the approximate location, and record required details depending on the issue type. 
* To check the status of a submitted report, a user simply goes to the “My Reports” page.
* To search reports made by other people, a user browses the “Other Reports” page and can filter them by either date, location, or issue type.


## Research Method - Contextual Inquiry 
**Contextual inquiry** is one of the best and most used research method to understand a user while they interact with the product in their usual setting. I conducted the semi-structured interview with my dad who fits some of the demographics and is most readily available.

I used **QuickTime Player** to videorecord the interview, **iPhone screenrecording** to record the app on my phone, and **Otter.ai** to transcribe the audio.

### Key Insights
:bulb: My dad believes it is important to report an issue for not only the individual but also for the community. The app is a community tool for keeping public spaces safe and clean. A motivating factor of reporting issues is the knowledge that it contributes to the well-being of the mojority and not just oneself. 

:bulb: My dad says he would like at least 30 minutes to submit a report, and with more use, he will gradually learn to use the app. Technical ability is important for being able to navigate the app efficiently but a good UX design that caters to those with multiple abilities is best. 

:bulb: My dad says he did not encounter any problems while using the app and attributes the lack of problems to his learning curve, in that he will improve over time. It seems like poor UX is not one of the problems for navigating the app because he thinks his technical ability can be improved, which, in turn, obscures the possibility of the system being a problem. 

## Reflection
I enjoyed the contextual inquiry since I was able to uncover some usability problems that I did not notice during my heuristic evaluation. The user, or my dad, does not have a high level of technical skill so observing him navigate the app brought many possible improvements to my attention. I had to direct the tasks and steps for using the app because of his technology skill level, as well as explain it in a way that would make most sense to him. I had to adapt and think on the spot in order to help him better understand the questions. Still, my iteration of his responses see to verify my own assumptions about him. I noticed he was a bit nervous too so I could include more icebreakers and not jump into the script right away.

Some drawbacks during the process:
* I could not keep a serious demeanor with my dad because our relationship involves lots of joking and teasing. At one point, my dad took a photo of himself as proof for a report on an illegal dumping. I made a joke that my dad would be considered illegal dummping because of the photo, prompting him to change the photo. I realize this would be very inappropriate with other people and in a real interview.
* I could tell my dad made up some of his responses to my questions, making me laugh and sound skeptical. Nonetheless, I will use the interview data in my project.
* I screenrecorded the app on my phone and video recorded on my laptop. The red screenrecording bar blocks a part of the screen, and I have to consolidate the two recordings into one video for easier analyzing. It is not the best way of recording so I will figure out a better method.

Overall, with the current situation, I feel like being "scrappy" and observing participants who are most readily available to me is learning to be resourceful and flexible--qualities that I find to be very important in the UX field and in the context of a new reality. Also, it was fun interacting with my dad in this situation because I saw a different side to him, in terms of personality and thinking, that I don't think I have seen before, which shows how important contextual inquiry and interviews are for understanding people.
