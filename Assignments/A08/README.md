# San José 311
## Lillian Nguyen

### Introduction
**San José 311** is a mobile app that allows people to help maintain the safety and cleanliness in their area by connecting them to city services. People can report non-emergency issues and track the status. and view reports made by other people. Stay updated on issues in the community with the ability to view and follow reports made by other people.

Being back in San Jose during the COVID-19 quarantine, I’ve decided to focus on my hometown for this project, specifically the unexplored resources that the city provides. I’ve lived in San Jose my entire life until I moved away to attend UCLA, where I realized the vast resources that the school provides. I wanted to explore whether my city offers anything cool and interesting for the public, so I browsed the internet and found two resources: an online archives catalog that conserves the city’s historic collections and an app to report any issues in the San Jose area. By improving the UX design, the site and app would become more user-friendly and accessible, creating a more well-informed and safe community.

### Design Statement
My project focuses on providing users a quick and effortless experience to complete tasks with ease. The goal is to not only allow users to complete their own tasks but to also generate an initial sense of community and curiosity amongst the San Jose residents. The app is mostly used to report issues in the area but it enables people to come together in keeping the city safe and clean. With this in mind, I redesigned the app to give users an "online community" of San Jose residents who work together in keeping the city well-maintained while making it easy to report and view their own reports.

### Competitor Analysis
The San Jose 311 app is a great resource for bringing people together to work toward a common goal. It is a convenient way to access and request city services, however improvements can be made to allow for a more seamless experience that motivates people to continue helping their community. Upon evaluating the app, I noticed issues with making a report, viewing my report, and searching for reports, which are basically the three main tasks of the app. [Read more...](https://github.com/lilliannguyen97/DH150/blob/master/Assignments/A01/README.md)

### User Research
From interacting with users, I found that the app is difficult to navigate for both high and low technical users due to the UI. One user stated that they will get better at using the app with time and continuous use, thinking his ability was the one to blame. This made me realize that people have become used to bad UX/UI, making them think all technology is good.

### UX Storytelling
In order to create better products centered around the user, it is important to understand their motives, frustrations, and needs. By doing this, we develop a successful solution to their problems and improve their experience. It helps to keep all stakeholders and team members stay focused on the problem area and work toward solving the same case. The stories are derived from prior research and then communicated through personas, empathy maps, and journey maps to empathize with the target audience and develop persuasive solutions.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype
Low-fidelity prototyping is a quick and low-cost way to design and test the contents of an artifact before fully investing time and money into developing the product. This allows you to get feedback from users, uncover problems early on, and make changes during the beginning stages of the design cycle. By making low-fidelity prototypes for my project, I can test the features of my design with users and make further improvements before working on the high-fidelity prototypes.

### High-Fidelity Prototype
High fidelity prototyping allows people to visualize the product while it is functional and interactive so that users could test it out and designers can continue to iterate and make improvements. The prototype was created using Adobe XD. After collecting user research data and creating personas/scenarios, I drew low-fidelity prototypes based on the needs of the targeted users. From there, I continued to revise my prototype based on the in-class impression test and cognitive walkthrough.
