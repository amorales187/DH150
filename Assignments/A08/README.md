# San José 311
### by Lillian Nguyen

With the **San José 311** mobile app, help maintain the safety and cleanliness of the city of San José by connecting to City services and crew. Report non-emergency issues and track the status at each phase. Stay updated on issues in the community by viewing and following reports made by other people.

## Introduction
As a San José local for all of my life, it is important to me that my community is safe and clean for everyone. The San José app has the potential to do more than be another platform for reporting issues; it can bring locals together to contribute towards keeping their home well-maintained and connected with the City services. The app aims to evoke a sense of community and curiosity, motivating people to be more aware of their surroundings. With each individual action is a collective effort towards building a safe, clean, and connected community.

## Design Statement
**How might I create an intuitive design that all community members can use efficiently and effortlessly?**
It is important to design an app that people with different levels of technology literacy to accomplish their tasks with ease. Keeping this in mind, it is important that the app provides a good user experience for all to inform and be informed through the reports submitted to the city. Having a transparent feedback system facilitates the connection between residents and City crew. The current state of the app causes unnecessary delays and confusion to both experienced and inexperienced tech users. 
To combat this, my design focuses on improving:
1. Creating and submitting a report
1. Checking the status of the report
1. Viewing reports made by other people

## Competitor Analysis
The San Jose 311 app is a great resource for bringing people together to work toward a common goal. It is a convenient way to access and request city services, however improvements can be made to allow for a more seamless experience that motivates people to continue helping their community. Upon evaluating the app, I noticed issues with making a report, viewing my report, and searching for reports, which are basically the three main tasks of the app. [Read more...](https://github.com/lilliannguyen97/DH150/blob/master/Assignments/A01/README.md)

## User Research
From interacting with users, I found that the app is difficult to navigate for both high and low technical users due to the UI. One user stated that they will get better at using the app with time and continuous use, thinking his ability was the one to blame. This made me realize that people have become used to bad UX/UI, making them think all technology is good.

## UX Storytelling
In order to create better products centered around the user, it is important to understand their motives, frustrations, and needs. By doing this, we develop a successful solution to their problems and improve their experience. It helps to keep all stakeholders and team members stay focused on the problem area and work toward solving the same case. The stories are derived from prior research and then communicated through personas, empathy maps, and journey maps to empathize with the target audience and develop persuasive solutions.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
Low-fidelity prototyping is a quick and low-cost way to design and test the contents of an artifact before fully investing time and money into developing the product. This allows you to get feedback from users, uncover problems early on, and make changes during the beginning stages of the design cycle. By making low-fidelity prototypes for my project, I can test the features of my design with users and make further improvements before working on the high-fidelity prototypes.

## High-Fidelity Prototype
High fidelity prototyping allows people to visualize the product while it is functional and interactive so that users could test it out and designers can continue to iterate and make improvements. The prototype was created using Adobe XD. After collecting user research data and creating personas/scenarios, I drew low-fidelity prototypes based on the needs of the targeted users. From there, I continued to revise my prototype based on the in-class impression test and cognitive walkthrough.
